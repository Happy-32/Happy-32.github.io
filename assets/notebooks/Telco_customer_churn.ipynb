    "Customer churn is one of the biggest problems companies face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet the size of the issue isn’t always fully appreciated. In reality, across the economy, the cost of churn is estimated at nearly $2 trillion every year. That’s as much as one of the world’s 10 largest economies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even at the level of individual companies, churn isn’t taken as seriously as it should be. In report 70% of companies don’t have visibility on the financial impacts of their customer experience efforts,specifically 44% of business leaders aren’t able to tell you their own company's churn rate. This speaks of a massive oversight when it comes to precise data on customer retention and loyalty.\n",
